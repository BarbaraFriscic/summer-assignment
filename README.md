# summer-assignment
**A static website created in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP**
-
Created as a summer assignment during my Web design course.

**1. Sublime was used to code the website and Xampp to generate the website locally.**

I was given a template website: https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page267/jof
According to the template I coded this website. I made it simpler in design.

**2.Website has Flexslider, UI Tabs, Data form validation, collection, emailing, Single news data editor**

This website was for practice, in the future I would like to turn it into a functional website using Wordpress.
